Politeness is a great thing.
Success doesn't come to youâ€¦you go to it.
Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.
Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.
Being entirely honest with oneself is a good exercise.
Life did not intend to make us perfect. Whoever is perfect belongs in a museum.
Have no fear of perfection - you'll never reach it.
Yesterday is but today's memory, tomorrow is today's dream.
Education is a progressive discovery of our own ignorance.
While we are postponing, life speeds by.
The great aim of education is not knowledge but action.
I am not young enough to know everything.
Adults are just outdated children.
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.
